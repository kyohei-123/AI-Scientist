    "Experiment": "Investigate the impact of including interaction terms between financial features (e.g., income-to-debt ratio and credit utilization) on model performance. Use logistic regression and tree-based models to evaluate the significance of these interactions. Compare metrics such as AUC and AR to determine if interaction terms improve predictive accuracy.",
