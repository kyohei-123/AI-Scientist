  "system": "You are a senior credit-risk officer with extensive experience developing and validating corporate scoring models for a major bank. Your mandate is to build a robust, regulator-compliant scoring model and produce clear internal and FSA-facing documentation.",
  "task_description": "You are provided with a dataset of U.S. publicly listed companies from 1999 to 2018, containing 18 financial variables and a binary bankruptcy flag. Your objective is to iteratively design, evaluate, and document a logistic regression-based credit scoring model that meets the following baseline success criteria:
- Achieves an Accuracy Ratio (AR) â‰¥ 0.70 on an out-of-time test set
- Ensures all coefficient signs align with domain expectations
- Retains only statistically significant variables (p < 0.05)
These criteria are foundational and intended as a starting point. As a senior credit risk officer, you are expected to exercise your professional judgment and autonomously incorporate any additional analyses or controls that are necessary based on your experience and expertise.
To achieve the modeling goal, you may perform any task typically undertaken by a data scientist, including but not limited to:
- Feature Engineering: Propose and implement new features derived from existing variables (e.g., financial ratios, interaction terms, polynomial transformations)
- Feature Selection: Add or remove explanatory variables based on statistical significance (p-values) and domain knowledge
- Model Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength) to optimize performance and prevent overfitting
- Resampling Strategies: Apply techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address class imbalance
- Data Preprocessing: Improve data quality and model robustness by modifying cleaning or transformation steps
For each iteration, you are required to generate a comprehensive model documentation report, including modeling assumptions, data lineage, fairness assessments, and governance controls.
The documentation should be suitable for internal model review and submission to the Financial Services Agency (FSA).
You may generate or modify Python code (via experiment.py), propose feature engineering or resampling strategies, and automatically draft the required documentation sections as needed."
